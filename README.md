HTML5 Drag Drop MVC Style
==================

* Drag & drop images (JPG, PNG, GIF) directly from your OS (folders, desktop, etc.)
* Like & dislike them.
* Go back to what you were doing. Duhh.

* An app using backbone for MVC in the frontend.
* Models, View/Controllers (in Backbone, Views are Controlelrs) & Routing (2 plain states - liked & unliked)
* HTML5 Supported Drag and drop from Native OS to inside browser, like how you drop files in DropBox.

_**Note**: You might need to resize the Browser for dropping images so that you can see both your OS folder and this app._

_**Note 2**: Drop only in the placeholder at top center of page, it will notify you of a supported drop !._
